# AnsysAPDLmac

AnsysAPDLmac is a library of macros that is designed to simplify the development and solving of problems using [Mechanical ANSYS APDL](https://www.ansys.com/). 

## Repository structure

- [B188] - smisc for constructing BEAM188 type diagrams
- [S181] - smisc for constructing SHELL181 type diagrams
- [algorithms] - applied algorithms implemented in APDL
- [calculations] - solving problems in different formulations
- [results] - output of results after solution
 
## Local installation

- Clone the repo in ANSYS Project: `git clone https://github.com/Yaro2709/AnsysAPDLmac`
- Run your project with Mechanical ANSYS APDL.
- Use macros, for example: `*use,results/UZ.mac`.
